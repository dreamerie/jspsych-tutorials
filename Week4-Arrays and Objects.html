// A quick introduction to Javascript objects.
// Objects in JavaScript can be considered an unordered collection of data, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
// Here this object has three properties that can be referenced by name (key)
var drink = {
  name: "taro milk",
  price: 5.5,
  available: true
}

drink.name // dot notation
drink["price"] // bracket notation

// 1. Add a new property to the object called sweetness and make it medium

drink.sweetness = "medium"
drink["sweetness"] = "low"

// 2. Taro milk is on sale. Decrease the price by $2.

drink.price-=2
// drink["price"]-=2

// 3. Taro milk is now sold out. Change the availability to false.

drink.available = false
drink["available"] = false

// We can consider the following menu as an array [] of objects.
// An array [] is a special object that can be referenced by number, while usually object properties are referenced by name.

var bbt_menu = [
 {
   name: "taro milk",
   price: 5.5,
   available: true
 },
 {
   name: "earl grey",
   price: 5,
   available: false
 },
 {
   name: "brown sugar",
   price: 6,
   available: true
 },
 {
   name: "wintermelon",
   price: 5.5,
   available: true
 },
 {
   name: "cacao barry",
   price: 5,
   available: false
 }
]

// Using your knowledge of arrays:
// 1. What is the first item in bbt_menu?

bbt_menu[0]

// 2. What is the price of the first item in bbt_menu?

bbt_menu[0].price
bbt_menu[0]["price"]

// 3. Can you add a fruit tea that costs $6 to bbt_menu?

bbt_menu.push({
  name: "fruit tea",
  price: 6,
  available: false
}
)

// We can consider the following menu as an object containing objects.
// The objects in the object have to be referenced by name.

var brunch_menu = {
 breakfast: {
    name: "breakfast special",
    price: 10
  },
 coffee: {
   name: "black coffee",
   price: 2.5
 },
 sandwich: {
   name: "club sandwich",
   price: 5
 },
 cookie: {
   name: "chocolate chip cookie",
   price: 3
 },
 cake: {
   name: "cheesecake",
   price: 5.5
 }
}

// How do we access the name and price of the cookie?

brunch_menu.cookie.price
brunch_menu["cookie"]["price"]

// We can loop through an array using numerical indexing, or for..of, but what about objects?
// We can use for...in

for (item in brunch_menu) {
  document.write(brunch_menu[item].name + " costs " + brunch_menu[item].price + "<p>")
}

// Why do we have to use brunch_menu[item].name instead of just item.name?
// Because "item" in the for.. in loop returns a string, not a variable.
// So brunch_menu["item"] becomes brunch_menu["breakfast"], brunch_menu["coffee"]

brunch_keys = Object.keys(brunch_menu)

// Object.values(brunch_menu)
// Object.entries(brunch_menu)

// Homework Exercises (v. short):
// 1. Add the property of sweetness (less sweet) to each bubble tea on the menu.
// 2. Add an item with a name and price to the brunch menu.

// I also ask you to ponder some conceptual questions.
// 1. Try using Object.keys and Object.values on an array. What happens?
// 2. Try using for..in instead of for..of on the coffee or milk arrays. What happens?
// 3. Fill in the blank: In JS, everything is __ _______.

// Introducing the Javascript function
function multiplyTwoNums(num1,num2) {
  return num1 * num2
}
